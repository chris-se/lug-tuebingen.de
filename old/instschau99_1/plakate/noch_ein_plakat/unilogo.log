a value of 4096 or more. Continue and I'll try to cope
with that big value; but it might be dangerous.

At least one of the coordinates in the path I'm about to
digitize was really huge (potentially bigger than 4095).
So I've cut it back to the maximum size.
The results will probably be pretty wild.
